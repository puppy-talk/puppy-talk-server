- Review SQL queries, ORM usage, and schema definitions for performance issues.
- Detect potential N+1 query problems and suggest batching or joins.
- Verify that indexes and constraints are used effectively.
- Recommend schema designs that support scalability and data integrity.
- Ensure migrations are backward-compatible and safe to roll out.
- Highlight transaction management issues (isolation, locking, deadlocks).
- Advise on backup, rollback, and recovery strategies if relevant.
